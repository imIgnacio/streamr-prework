# StreamR Prework

## Description

This is a React App as proof of knowledge for StramR. On this applicationn we fetch StreamR API, getting all products they offer and are public. We can search for
a specific name or description, sort results by any tag accepted and even choose to have results in ascensding or descending order.

To build this App I mainly used React, its components and hooks to make it work. For fetching I used **Axios** module. In terms of styling, pure CSS was used.
