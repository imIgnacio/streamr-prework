# StreamR Prework

## Description

This is a React App as proof of knowledge for StramR. On this applicationn we fetch StreamR API, getting all products they offer and are public. We can search for
a specific name or description, sort results by any tag accepted and even choose to have results in ascensding or descending order.

To build this App I mainly used React, its components and hooks to make it work. For fetching I used **Axios** module. In terms of styling, pure CSS was used.

## Installation

You will need Node.js installed on your local machine.

- Clone the repository to your local development environment git clone https://github.com/imIgnacio/streamr-prework

Dependencies used for this project are:

- `React`
- `React DOM`
- `Axios`

To run locally this application we use `npm run start` script in terminal.

To build the React App we use `npm run build` script in terminal.

## Usage

The use of this application is simple. It will fetch all information when you enter the website. After it shows all cards with products available. To search for
any specific products that one could require, simply type a name or description, then choose any sort field and finally choose the order of rendering. Please note
that **Sort** and **Order** fields must be applied at the same time, using only one of those will not do anything.
